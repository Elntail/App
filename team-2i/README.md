## How to run the app

```
Run the app on Android Studio by building the app then "Run App"

Afterwards, please enter your name and then press the submit button.

You should be looking at the menu screen, although the only button available is the Hangman button. Click it.

Unless you lived under a rock, you know how Hangman works.

If you don't:

    You can enter either a word or a letter in the box below the gallow.

    If the word is not equal to the length of the answer, the gallow will not update.

    But if its is either a singular letter or the length is equals to, and it does not match the input (letter not present within the word or word doesn't match) then Steve, the guy being hung, will have one limb added.

    If all of his limbs are added, then you lose.

    You win if you can guess the whole word or if can guess all of the letters.


Other features are to be implemented.
